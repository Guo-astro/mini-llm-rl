# Mini-LLM-RL Library

## Acknowledgments

A big thank you to the author of
the [Mini-R1: Reproduce Deepseek R1 „Aha Moment“ – A Reinforcement Learning Tutorial](https://www.philschmid.de/mini-deepseek-r1)
for the excellent article that inspired this project.

## Overview

I have transformed the concepts from the tutorial into a robust library, utilizing **uv** for cleaner and more efficient
dependency management. This library is optimized to run on **macOS Sonoma** (and later versions) using CPU, ensuring
compatibility and ease of use for developers working in a macOS environment.

## Features

- **Library Implementation**: Converts the tutorial into a reusable library format.
- **Dependency Management**: Leverages **uv** for streamlined and maintainable dependencies.
- **macOS Compatibility**: Specifically optimized to work on macOS Sonoma and newer versions using CPU.

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Guo-astro/mini-llm-rl
    cd mini-llm-rl
    uv sync
    ```

## Usage

See main.py for an example of how to use the library.
